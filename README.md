## üîç Description  
LC-Inspector is an open-source application for analyzing targeted mass spectrometry data. 

It allows you to process raw mass spectrometry and/or chromatography files and look for a set of compounds or peaks, trace their intensities, graph and export them (also the raw data), check with databases via MS/MS, and quantify using calibration standards.

<a name="features"/>

## ‚ú® Features
* Trace compounds in raw mass spec data
* Analyze and process LC/GC spectra 
* View the underlying MS spectra, scan by scan
* Graph and export your data in SVG, TIFF, PNG, JPG or CSV formats 
* Calculate concentrations using in-built calibration features 
* Compare with integrated MS/MS libraries 
* Vendor-agnostic, accepts any .mzML and .txt files 
* Process everything on your machine without registration/uploading to external websites or servers
* Easy UI, works on Windows and macOS >

## ‚õØ Usage

### User-interface

LC-Inspector simplifies the MS analysis process to only a few steps: 

1. Drag and drop your mass spectrometry files into the main window 
2. Choose a list of metabolites to look for in the MS data or define your own 
3. Click **Process** 
4. View the results: 
* raw data, scan by scan;
* extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of your compounds;
* total ion current (TIC);
* chromatograms labelled with your compounds' retention times;
* (optional) ion mobility data

5. Verify the structure of your compounds with MS/MS database matching
6. Quantify based on MS and/or chromatography data

The user can upload and process the data entirely locally on their machine. No need to register an account anywhere or upload to external websites or web servers.

### Running from source 

1.  Clone the repository or download the compressed version and unpack
2.  Install Python 3.12 or later
3.  Navigate to the folder containing `main.py` in the terminal
4.  Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Prepare the input data
6.  Run the script via `main.py` using `python3 main.py`

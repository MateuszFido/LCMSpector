## üîç Description  
LCMSpector is an open-source application for analyzing targeted mass spectrometry data. 

It allows you to process raw mass spectrometry and/or chromatography files and look for a set of compounds or peaks, trace their intensities, graph and export them (also the raw data), check with databases via MS/MS, and quantify using calibration standards.

For more information, visit the [LCMSpector wiki](https://github.com/MateuszFido/LCMSpector/wiki)!

<a name="features"/>

## ‚ú® Features
* Trace compounds in raw mass spec data
* Analyze and process LC/GC spectra 
* View the underlying MS spectra, scan by scan
* Graph and export your data in SVG, TIFF, PNG, JPG or CSV formats 
* Calculate concentrations using in-built calibration features 
* Compare with integrated MS/MS libraries 
* Vendor-agnostic, accepts any .mzML and .txt files 
* Process everything on your machine without registration/uploading to external websites or servers
* Easy UI, works on Windows and macOS >

## üíΩ Installation 

### Desktop app

Executables for Windows and macOS are published under [Releases](https://github.com/MateuszFido/LC-Inspector/releases).

*   On Windows, if you encounter a warning, go to `Windows Defender -> Protection history -> LC-Inspector`, find the LC-Inspector entry, and click `Restore`. If the warning "Windows protected your PC" appears, click `More info` and `Run anyway`.
*   On MacOS, you can remove the app from quarantine by running the following command: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app.app`

If the app has not been quarantined but isn't running, go to `System settings -> Privacy and security -> scroll down -> Open anyway`

If running from source, you only need to execute `python3 main.py`.

### Running from source 

1.  Clone the repository or download the compressed version and unpack
2.  Install Python 3.12 or later
3.  Navigate to the folder containing `main.py` in the terminal
4.  Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Prepare the input data
6.  Run the script via `main.py` using `python3 main.py`

<a name="usage"/>

## ‚õØ Usage

LC-Inspector simplifies the MS analysis process to only a few steps: 

1. Drag and drop your mass spectrometry files into the main window 
2. Choose a list of metabolites to look for in the MS data or define your own 
3. Click **Process** 
4. View the results: 
* raw data, scan by scan;
* extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of your compounds;
* total ion current (TIC);
* chromatograms labelled with your compounds' retention times;
* (optional) ion mobility data

5. Verify the structure of your compounds with MS/MS database matching
6. Quantify based on MS and/or chromatography data

The user can upload and process the data entirely locally on their machine. No need to register an account anywhere or upload to external websites or web servers.

[Here is an overview](https://github.com/MateuszFido/LCMSpector/wiki) of what LCMSpector can do! 


## üê≥ Running with Docker

---

Docker is a fantastic alternative if you don't want to install the app directly on your system. 

### MacOS

### 1. Install XQuartz (if you don't have it already)

Download and install XQuartz from:  
https://www.xquartz.org/

- After installation, open XQuartz.
- Go to **XQuartz > Preferences > Security** and check:  
  **"Allow connections from network clients"**
- Restart XQuartz if you changed the setting.

---

### 2. Allow Docker to Connect to XQuartz

Open a terminal on your Mac and run:

```bash
xhost + 127.0.0.1
```

---

### 3. Pull the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull mateuszfido/lcmspector:latest
```

---

### 4. Run the Docker Container

In **the same** terminal, run:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 \
  mateuszfido/lcmspector:latest
```
---

If you have issues:
- Make sure XQuartz is running and "Allow connections from network clients" is checked.
- Make sure your Mac firewall allows incoming connections for XQuartz.
- Try restarting XQuartz or your terminal session.
